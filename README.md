# Data cleaning and validation

A point i have to practice more is identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and outliers in a dataset.
The intention i had with this script is to get closer to answering the question.

**how do you know if your data cleaning is effective and accurate?**


This repo is aimed to be a collection of cleaned and validated dataset.

The outcome of the repository hopefully is a library that i can reference with different dataset formats.
